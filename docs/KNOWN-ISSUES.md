# Known Issues

This is the short, current-state issue tracker for GW2 Crafting Helper. It
holds:

1. The **numbered issue catalog** below - every issue this project has ever
   logged, kept under its original number, with a short resolution
   summary. `.cs` source comments cite these as `KNOWN-ISSUES #N` (or a
   decimal sub-item like `#20.1`); this file is where `#N` still resolves.
2. The **[DEFERRED](#deferred-recorded-not-implemented)** list at the
   bottom: items that are genuinely still open.

**Looking for the full investigation?** Every item below - hypotheses,
instrumentation, root-cause traces, live-verification transcripts, and
dated gate PASS records - has its complete original write-up in
[`docs/dev-notes/HISTORY.md`](dev-notes/HISTORY.md), under the identical
item number. This file only keeps the short version.

**Looking for *why* a piece of code is shaped the way it is**, rather than
the story of how a specific bug was found and fixed?
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) distills the durable rationale
for the handful of mechanisms (scroll preserve/restore, the resize
relayout registry, the wheel-delta sanitizer, merged-ceil vendor batching,
solver decision rules, and so on) that this history produced.

## Numbered issue catalog

### Items 1-11: M30 wave (initial hands-on pass, post-M29)

All eleven were fixed in M30. Briefly: (1) pill-click scroll reset -
restore/verify is now driven by a per-frame `FrameTicker` rather than a
same-frame `QueueMainThreadUpdate` re-queue. (2) resize-drag flicker/
transient tree collapse - full dispose+rebuild on every drag tick replaced
with a 150ms trailing debounce. (3) Total Cost currency rows gained icons.
(4) more vertical spacing between major sections. (5) collapsed Recipe
Tree containers now contract correctly (no stale whitespace). (6) Shopping
List Amount/Each/Total columns gained inter-column spacing. (7) row
dividers now use a consistent higher-contrast color. (8) Ball of Dark
Energy (and four HoT map-completion Gifts) - unpriceable items now render
a wiki-verified acquisition-hint tooltip instead of a misleading "only
available source" message. (9) rarity text brightened for parchment-
background contrast. (10) window content region resized to 684px high /
26px margin to stop texture bleed-through. (11) decision pill labels now
render in white instead of their own border color.

### 12. Fast wheel-up scroll: net-downward stutter (FIXED in M33, reopened and root-caused in M36)

Rapid wheel-up bursts could scroll up then jump back down further than
they went up. Root cause (M33): the old scroll-verify loop required
content height to be stable frame-to-frame before trusting the scrollbar's
live value, and nested `AutoSize` convergence kept height fluctuating for
several frames after every rebuild - closed by making container heights
synchronous (`PlanContentHeightMath`) and having the verify window yield
immediately on any observed wheel event. Reopened in M36: a real defect in
the *shipped* Blish HUD v1.3.0 binary (`MouseEventArgs.WheelDelta`
mis-unwraps a Windows-coalesced multi-notch wheel event as a huge negative
delta) was root-caused by decompiling the vendored binary and fixed
module-side with `WheelDeltaSanitizer`. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
sections 1-3.

### 13. Resize UX rework: live reflow, no settle stutter (FIXED in M33)

Live in-place relayout during a resize drag (no dispose+rebuild), driven
by the `_relayoutActions`/`_reellipsisActions` registry described in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 5.

### 14. Pill-click viewport flash (jump to top and back) (FIXED in M33)

Closed by the same synchronous-height-contract fix as item 12.

### 15. Shopping tag text contrast (VENDOR / SALVAGE / UNKNOWN)

Logged as a contrast follow-up to the M30 #11 pill-label fix (which only
covered tree pills, not shopping-list source tags). No explicit resolution
note was recorded against this item number in the original backlog; full
context in `dev-notes/HISTORY.md`.

### 16. Vendor-source items show no price

Logged: vendor-decision rows rendered empty Each/Total cells, including
non-coin currency costs. The currency-icon rendering pipeline
(`CoinCurrencyRenderer`, `CurrencyDisplayResolver`) that this item asked
for is in production use today. No explicit "(FIXED in Mxx)" note was
recorded against this item number in the original backlog; full context
in `dev-notes/HISTORY.md`.

### 17. Seed data gaps: false UNKNOWNs in the Exordium tree (FIXED in M33)

Three of four original hypotheses were wrong (confirmed by wiki research
and an offline Harness dump): most "false UNKNOWN" nodes were actually a
solver bug (stopped evaluating siblings after the first unpriceable
ingredient), not a seed gap. The one real gap - Mystic Clover had no
Mystic Forge recipe seeded - was added (wiki-verified EV pricing). A
stale, wiki-removed vendor offer for Gift of Battle was also identified
and later removed as a Wave B follow-up.

### 18. Multi-source decision display is inconsistent

Logged: a node priced via one source (e.g. TP) could render a pill for a
different source (e.g. VENDOR). The decision-pill-must-match-committed-
source invariant this item asked for is covered today by
`DecisionPillPlannerTests`. No explicit "(FIXED in Mxx)" note was recorded
against this item number in the original backlog; full context in
`dev-notes/HISTORY.md`.

### 19. Resize-drag scroll reset on height change (FIXED in M33)

Part of the same synchronous height-contract / relayout-registry fix as
items 12-14.

### 20. M34: gw2efficiency owned-materials parity + correctness fixes

- **20.1** Obsidian Shard 179x showing Total 186 (not 180): a merged-ceil
  vendor-batch rounding bug, fixed - see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 7.
- **20.2** Vendor purchase caps no longer hard-exclude an offer; they now
  produce a warn-only notice instead of removing the offer from
  consideration.
- **20.3** Stale "Building final result..." status race between two
  independently-scheduled callbacks, fixed by `StatusUpdateGuard` - see
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 6.
- **20.4** Owned-materials parity scope: per-node owned-quantity
  attribution, primary-option-only pool consumption, the "Value Own
  Materials" force-buy pre-pass (gw2e's `valueOwnItems` rule), owned
  currency as a display-only annotation (never fed back into the solve),
  the "Using N owned" pill, and the Ignore-pill mechanism (zeroes a node's
  own cost contribution tree-wide by item id, deliberately not cascading
  gw2e's full quantity re-derivation - an explicitly recorded, narrower
  substitute).

### 21. M35: gw2efficiency parity - multi-item plans

Multi-item batch planning: a synthetic wrapper recipe prices N selected
item roots together in one pass (Services layer), with a multi-row UI
(Views layer) showing each root's own decision. Several deliberate,
recorded divergences from gw2e's own multi-item UX (no per-node "Crafting
Profit" pill on individual roots yet; no drag-to-reorder rows).

### 22. Ignore-pill click sets status to "Best path restored" (cosmetic) (FIXED in M37, see #27)

### 23. Horizontal dividers appear/disappear with scroll position (FIXED in M36; M36b follow-up for 44px/32px rows)

Root cause: Blish's `Container.Paint` clips a divider drawn exactly at a
row's bottom edge unpredictably depending on scroll phase. M36b gave
`CreateRowDivider` a `bottomClearance` parameter (1 extra logical pixel of
gap for the vulnerable 44px/32px row types), proven immune by simulation
across every row height and all four GW2 UI Size scale factors - this is
DO-NOT-TOUCH machinery, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 3.
Required Recipes and Crafting Steps were live pixel-scan verified at
multiple scroll offsets after the fix; Required Disciplines (32px rows)
was simulation-proven at the time but not yet individually pixel-scanned
in that same pass - **this gap was closed by item 30 below** (M37 live
desktop session, 2026-07-22, scanned Required Disciplines directly and
confirmed the same clean result the simulation predicted).

### M38 view-decomposition entries (WP-21 through WP-25)

Not separately numbered in the original backlog (recorded there as
`WP-22`/`WP-23`/`WP-23b`/`WP-23c`/`WP-23d + WP-24`/`WP-25` narrative
entries, plus the WP-26 cut decision). See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section
5 for the durable summary of what moved where and why, and
`dev-notes/HISTORY.md` for the full diff-evidence and live-verification
record of each increment.

### 24. Homestead refinement handling (parity gap) (FIXED in M37)

The module's seed already carried all Homestead Refinement offer rows,
unconditionally, with no tier concept - so it silently priced every
account as if it owned every efficiency upgrade at every station (the
opposite of gw2e's conservative tier-0 default), with no way to turn it
off. Fixed: a per-material (Fiber/Metal/Wood) tier setting
(`HomesteadEfficiencyTiers`, default tier 0, matching gw2e's own default),
wiki-scraped `HomesteadTier` tagging on the relevant vendor offers, and a
solver-side filter that excludes any offer above the configured tier.
Deliberately NOT implemented: a "do you even own Homestead" master gate
(gw2e has none either) and the Homestead Black Market purchase path
(wiki game-id resolution gap, still unseeded).

### 25. Multi-item sell-side economics (parity gap, deliberate M35 gap) (FIXED in M37)

M35 left sell-value/profit rollups unset for multi-item batches. Fixed:
`SellSideEconomics.ApplyBatchSellSideEconomics` sums each qualifying
root's own sellable quantity/net sale value/profit into batch totals.
Deliberately diverges from gw2e in two ways (both recorded in
`dev-notes/HISTORY.md` with the reasoning): the rollup does not filter
out a bought-but-tradable root the way gw2e's `craft === true` filter
does, and an untradable crafted root is excluded entirely (contributes
zero) rather than silently absorbed as a hidden cost the way gw2e's own
upstream code does it.

### 26. Achievement-bit ingredient dedup (parity micro-gap) (FIXED in M37)

gw2e de-duplicates ingredients tagged with an achievement-reward
`achievement_bit` across the whole tree (relevant to 7 recovered custom
recipes - WvW siege-weapon-blueprint achievement rewards). Ported 1:1 via
a new `AchievementBitDedupPrePass` (pure, Blish-free), run once per fresh
tree build. A `DecisionPillPlanner` "COUNTED ELSEWHERE" pill replaces the
plain HAVE pill on a deduped node. Two related latent bugs found and
fixed during this work: a zeroed-but-mismatched-source node could leave a
standalone zero-cost ghost row in the plan (general `PlanSolver.Collect`
guard added), and new achievement/merchant recipe ids adjacent to the
Mystic Forge id range could NRE on a cold cache miss (fixed with a real
membership check).

### 27. Ignore-pill click status label (FIXED in M37, closes #22)

Root cause: the status-text choice used "did any overrides exist" as a
proxy for "was this the Best Path preset", so the Ignore toggle (which
never touches overrides) incorrectly printed the Best Path preset's own
label. Fixed with an explicit `isBestPathPreset` flag threaded to a new
`StatusText.ForOverrideResolve` helper.

### 28. Vendor cap data seeding + stale-offer sweep (PARTIAL - core FIXED in M37; gaps deferred)

Seeded real daily/weekly purchase caps for 689 of ~53,530 vendor offers
from wiki SMW properties (previously all null, making the M34 warn-only
cap machinery inert). A scoped stale-offer sweep (offers reachable from
seeded recipe trees only, ~10.2% of the total) found 2 genuinely
discontinued offers (removed, wiki-confirmed via patch notes) out of 394
raw candidates - the rest were scraper coverage gaps or wiki page
renames, not real removals. Character/total purchase caps remain
unseeded (no account/character concept exists in this module). See the
DEFERRED list below for the specific named gaps (Skirmish Merchant page
split, one unresolvable vendor-page rename, the wiki-drift superset).

### 29. Owned-materials UI live verification (VERIFIED in M37, live desktop session 2026-07-22)

### 30. Required Disciplines divider pixel-scan (VERIFIED in M37, live desktop session 2026-07-22)

Closes the gap item 23 left open: Required Disciplines (32px rows) was
scanned directly at two scroll offsets and matched the simulation's
predicted clean result exactly.

### 31. Concurrency and degradation audits (verification debt) (FIXED in M37)

Three formal audits (cross-thread await marshaling; offline/API-down
degradation per endpoint; price-cache thread-safety), 9 confirmed
findings fixed. Highlights: a Clear-Cache-races-a-background-refresh
resurrection bug (fixed with a new `SnapshotEpochGuard`); a validation
no-op that could permanently stick-disable the Generate button; a
snapshot-fetch path that silently returned an empty, fully-timestamped
snapshot on total failure instead of throwing (now throws
`SnapshotFetchFailedException`, never persisted); several unguarded batch
loops that aborted an entire fetch on one bad batch instead of degrading
per-batch; a price-fetch stampede under overlapping generate calls (fixed
with in-flight fetch tracking in `TradingPostService`).

### 32. StyleCop analyzer debt: SA1101/SA1200 suppressed, smaller rules tracked (M38 WP-02)

A code-review finding caught that two default-severity rules (SA1101
"prefix local calls with this", SA1200 "using directive must appear
within the namespace") were 61% of every warning the WP-02 ruleset
produced, fighting an established codebase convention rather than
catching drift against one. Both suppressed with the same inline-rationale
style as the pre-existing SA1309 suppression. Three smaller rules with a
non-trivial footprint (SA1413/SA1516/SA1503) are left enabled and recorded
as a future cleanup candidate.

### 33. Astral Acclaim package: Wizard's Vault seasonal purchase cap seeding (2026-07-22)

Seeded the wiki's "Has seasonal purchase cap" SMW property (item 28's
deferred fifth cap type) for Wizard's Vault offers, and wired a new
`TimegatedCapType.Seasonal` through `VendorBatchSolver.FinalizeVendorBatches`
so a seasonal cap produces its own warn-only notice independently of
daily/weekly. Confirmed Bag of Coins (1 Gold) is genuinely tiered (two
separate vendor offers/game ids, not one row with two prices) - no
model/solver change needed, the solver's existing cheapest-offer selection
already handles it. One offer (Lesser Essence of Gold) hit a reproducible
SMW property-chain resolution gap and was left byte-identical rather than
guessing its game id.

### 34. Dead live-wiki vendor-offer resolver removed (M38 WP-10)

`VendorOfferResolver`/`IWikiVendorClient`/`WikiLookupOptions` and their
test double were deleted: `Module.cs` always constructed the pipeline with
`resolver: null`, so every branch guarded on it was unreachable by
construction. Superseded by the static seed-store path
(`VendorOfferLoader`/`VendorOfferStore`, populated offline). Recorded
dissent: the architecture analyst argued for keep-and-comment instead of
delete; deletion was chosen (also removed the test suite's single largest
real-time cost - retry/backoff `Task.Delay`s). A clean `git revert`
restores the seam if a live-wiki resolve mode is wanted again.

### 35. M39 module log system: WP-16/WP-17 subsumption + JSONL/rotation rationale (FIXED in M39)

The M39 log-system PR fully implemented M38's planned WP-16 (persistence-
store failure logging, replacing silent `Debug.WriteLine`) and WP-17
(Module.cs catch-consistency + FrameTicker unload teardown) as a side
effect; this entry records that subsumption so neither gets duplicated.
Also records why the log store uses newline-delimited JSON rather than one
big JSON array (crash-safety: a partial trailing line is recoverable, a
mid-write corrupt array is not) and its two independent rotation caps
(2 MB size / 14 day age, both user-configurable and clamped against
out-of-range persisted values).

## DEFERRED (recorded, not implemented)

Carried over verbatim from the original backlog (full context:
`dev-notes/HISTORY.md`), plus two additional still-open items folded in
from items 31 and 32 below (marked as such) so this list covers every
genuinely open item, not just the ones originally filed under a
"DEFERRED" heading.

- Localization (en/de/fr/es via API lang param): user-deferred backlog,
  "not core functionality". Full-milestone scale when picked up.
- Upstream Blish HUD issue/PR for the wheel-delta wrap: REMOVED from the
  backlog entirely by user decision (2026-07-22) - no upstream posts are
  planned. The module-side sanitizer stays until a fixed Blish release
  ships, then can be retired at leisure.
- Ignore-pill cascade semantics + own-materials gating divergences
  (#20.4): revisit only on user feedback.
- Multi-item row reordering (gw2e moveRecipe): out of scope per M35.
- Skirmish Merchant-family wiki page split (#28, 18 offers): Skirmish
  Supervisor / Lionguard (Skirmish Merchant) / Mercenary (Skirmish
  Merchant) wiki pages were restructured into /Armor, /Weapons, /Others
  subpages; the items are still sold in-game under the split pages, but
  the seed's merchant-page linkage is now stale-shaped. Missing-offer/
  rename gap for a future re-scrape to follow up; not removed.
- "Merchant (Untamed Crags)" vendor-page-name mismatch (#28, 1 offer):
  the Hydrocatalytic Reagent / 50 Research Note offer's exact vendor
  page no longer resolves on the wiki (no page, no redirect), while the
  item and cost remain valid via other crafting-material vendors.
  Deferred pending research into whether the page was renamed or the
  original scrape mislabeled the vendor.
- Wiki-drift missing-offers superset (#28, ~5,400 offers): M37's full
  from-scratch re-scrape (for cap seeding) incidentally picked up new
  Homestead recipes and unrelated vendor page changes beyond the
  stale-offer-sweep scope. Discarded uncommitted; recorded here as a
  candidate for a future dedicated "missing offers" pass.
- Character/total purchase caps (#28): the wiki's "Has character
  purchase cap" and "Has total purchase cap" SMW properties are real and
  populated (confirmed in M37) but remain deliberately unseeded - the
  module has no account/character concept at all. Left for a future
  milestone's own design pass. ("Has seasonal purchase cap" is no longer
  in this bucket - seeded for Wizard's Vault by item 33, and item 33's
  own later entry records that its runtime consumption was also wired up
  via `TimegatedCapType.Seasonal`, so nothing about seasonal caps remains
  deferred; this parenthetical is corrected from the original record,
  which predated that wiring.)
- Homestead `HomesteadUnlocked` master gate (#24): gw2e has no "do you
  even own Homestead" gate at all; this module echoes that (no gate),
  matching v1's fixed design decision. A prior research draft flagged a
  divergence option (default-off master gate, since this module runs
  in-client for players who may never have touched Janthir Wilds) -
  recorded as a future confirm-with-maintainer option, not implemented.
- Homestead Black Market path (#24): 300 purchases of 25/week per
  station, coin-only, tier-independent - confirmed still entirely
  unseeded (the live re-scrape used for tier tagging failed wiki
  game-id resolution for all 30 Black Market rows across the three
  stations). A future milestone could seed these as plain vendor
  offers once that resolution gap is separately investigated.
- **(folded in from item 31c-2, NiceToHave)** Price-cache eviction
  policy: `TradingPostService`'s price cache has no eviction - every item
  id ever priced during the module's process lifetime stays resident
  (refreshed in place, never removed). Bounded and unlikely to matter at
  current GW2 item-id cardinality; a periodic sweep or LRU/size cap
  remains a future candidate.
- **(folded in from item 32)** StyleCop SA1413/SA1516/SA1503: left at
  default severity with a non-trivial pre-existing footprint (253/174/123
  warnings respectively); a future cleanup wave candidate.
